## 3. Database Design & Data Flow

### 3.1 Database Schema
```sql
-- Core Tables
interview_questions {
  id: UUID (Primary Key)
  question: TEXT
  category: VARCHAR
  difficulty: ENUM
  expected_answer_points: TEXT[]
  is_active: BOOLEAN
  created_at: TIMESTAMP
}

interview_sessions {
  id: UUID (Primary Key)
  user_id: UUID (Foreign Key → auth.users)
  status: ENUM (in_progress, completed)
  started_at: TIMESTAMP
  completed_at: TIMESTAMP
  overall_score: DECIMAL
  total_questions: INTEGER
  current_question_index: INTEGER
}

interview_responses {
  id: UUID (Primary Key)
  session_id: UUID (Foreign Key → interview_sessions)
  question_id: UUID (Foreign Key → interview_questions)
  response_text: TEXT
  score: INTEGER
  created_at: TIMESTAMP
}
```

### 3.2 Security Policies (RLS)
```sql
-- Restrict question access to authenticated users only
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view active questions" 
ON interview_questions FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND is_active = true);

-- Users can only access their own sessions
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own sessions" 
ON interview_sessions FOR ALL 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## 4. AI Assessment Algorithm

### 4.1 Scoring Methodology
```typescript
// Intelligent keyword matching with weighted scoring
const score = Math.min(
  expectedAnswerPoints.reduce((acc, point) => {
    const keywords = point.toLowerCase().split(' ');
    const responseWords = response.toLowerCase();
    const matches = keywords.filter(keyword => 
      responseWords.includes(keyword)
    );
    return acc + (matches.length / keywords.length) * 25;
  }, 0),
  100
);
```

### 4.2 Feedback Generation
- **Performance-Based Responses**: Contextual feedback based on score ranges
- **Encouraging Tone**: Positive reinforcement for all performance levels
- **Educational Value**: Constructive guidance for improvement areas
